# Getting Started with Phumble

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In the project directory, run `npm install` to set up the dependencies, then `npm start` to run the app in the development mode. The running app can then be viewed in the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

This project is configured to fetch from the [Pexels Photo Library](https://www.pexels.com) API. Each user requires a key to access the API; the literal key was left out of this codebase by substituting an environment variable (`REACT_APP_API_KEY`), defined in the `.env` file.

Other than that, I hope you find it easy to use, with a soothing color palette. I certainly had fun making it!
